# TimeWeaver

TimeWeaver is a local-first task planning tool that helps turn vague goals into realistic, time-blocked plans.

You describe *what* you want to do and *how much time* you have.  
TimeWeaver helps you break it down and map it onto your calendar.

## Philosophy

- Planning before tracking
- Time as a first-class constraint
- Simple, local, and transparent

## Status

Early development. Core planning logic comes first, UI later.
